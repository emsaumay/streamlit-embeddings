1. Shared Libraries: All scripts will likely use the `openai` library for interacting with the ada-002 model. The scripts `src/generate_embeddings.py` and `src/save_embeddings_to_csv.py` will likely use `pandas` for data manipulation and saving to CSV. The `src/streamlit_app.py` will use the `streamlit` library for creating the web application.

2. Shared Data: The embeddings generated by `src/generate_embeddings.py` and saved by `src/save_embeddings_to_csv.py` will be used by both `src/streamlit_app.py` and `src/question_answering.py`. 

3. Shared Functions: A function to generate embeddings from the ada-002 model might be used in both `src/generate_embeddings.py` and `src/question_answering.py`. A function to load embeddings from a CSV file might be used in both `src/streamlit_app.py` and `src/question_answering.py`.

4. Shared Variables: The path to the CSV file containing the embeddings might be a shared variable across all scripts.

5. Shared DOM Elements: In `src/streamlit_app.py`, there might be a text input DOM element with a specific id for users to input their questions, and a button DOM element with a specific id to submit the question. The id names of these elements will be shared with any JavaScript functions that interact with them.

6. Shared Message Names: If the system uses message passing for communication between different parts of the app, there might be shared message names like "question_submitted" or "answer_generated".
