1. Python Libraries: Both "langchain_script.py" and "embeddings_file.txt" will require Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and gensim for generating and handling the embeddings. 

2. Research Paper Data: The "research_paper.txt" file is the data source that is shared between "langchain_script.py" and "embeddings_file.txt". The script will read the research paper and the generated embeddings will be based on this data.

3. Embeddings: The embeddings generated by "langchain_script.py" will be saved in "embeddings_file.txt". Hence, the embeddings are a shared dependency.

4. Functions: Functions for reading the research paper, generating embeddings, and saving embeddings will be shared between "langchain_script.py" and "embeddings_file.txt". 

5. File Paths: The file paths for "research_paper.txt" and "embeddings_file.txt" will be shared in "langchain_script.py" as it needs to know where to read the data from and where to save the embeddings.

6. Variable Names: Variables such as 'research_paper' (to store the content of the research paper), 'embeddings' (to store the generated embeddings) will be shared between the script and the embeddings file.
